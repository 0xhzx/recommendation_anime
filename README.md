# recommendation_anime

## Purpose
Our project aims to recommend anime based on anime's info and users' preferences. Our dataset comes from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020). We plan to use three distinct approach to construct our recommendation system:

1. Naive Approach: Recommend the top k anime based on genre and scores. Users are allowed to input the genre they want to watch and the system would return the top k anime with the input genre with the highest scores.

2. Content-based filtering: We will use the anime's features genre to recommend similar anime based on the user's preference.

3. Neural network-based Collaborative filtering: 

## Feature
- Collected a comprehensive dataset of anime from Kaggle, including anime title, genre, type, episodes, score, rating, etc. as well as user ratings for each anime.
- Implemented three recommendation systems through three different approaches: naive, machine learning (content-based filtering), and collaborative filtering (neural network-based).
- Provided extensive documentation and codebase for the models' training processes.
- Conducted a thorough evaluation and comparison of model outputs.


### Model Train

#### 1. Naive Approach

The naive approach is to recommend the top k anime based on genre and scores. Users are allowed to input the genre they want to watch and the system would return the top k anime with the input genre with the highest scores. The score feature was already used in the dataset.

#### 2. Machine Learning Approach (Content-based filtering)


#### 3. Deep Learning Approach (NCF - Neural Network-based Collaborative Filtering)


### Model Evaluation
